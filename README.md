## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option A — Offline (no server, single device)

Just open `public/index.html` directly in your browser. Data is saved in the browser's `localStorage`.

> Works great for personal use on one device. No Node.js required.

---

### Option B — Network server (all devices synced)

Requires [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org).

**1. Install dependencies** (once):
```bash
npm install
```

**2. Start the server:**

| OS | Command |
|----|---------|
| Mac / Linux | `bash start.sh` |
| Windows | Double-click `start.bat` |
| Any | `npm start` |

**3. Open in your browser:**

| Device | URL |
|--------|-----|
| Laptop | http://localhost:3000 |
| Phone / Tablet | `http://YOUR_LAPTOP_IP:3000` |

> Your phone and laptop must be on the **same WiFi network**.  
> The start script prints your laptop's IP address automatically.

## 📁 Project Structure

```
worldcup-predictor-league/
├── public/
│   └── index.html      ← The entire app (single file)
├── server.js           ← Express + SQLite server
├── start.sh            ← Start script (Mac/Linux)
├── start.bat           ← Start script (Windows)
├── package.json
├── .gitignore
└── README.md
```

> **`data/`** folder is created automatically when the server first runs. It holds the SQLite database and is excluded from git.

## 🗄️ How Data is Stored

| Mode | Storage | Shared across devices? |
|------|---------|----------------------|
| Offline (file://) | Browser localStorage | ❌ No |
| Online (server) | `data/leaderboard.db` (SQLite) | ✅ Yes |

The app auto-detects which mode to use. A banner at the top tells you which mode is active.

## 🏆 Ranking Rules

Players are sorted by:
1. **Points** (higher = better)
2. **Guesses** (more = better, as a tiebreaker)
3. **Name** (alphabetical, Arabic/English aware)

Ties are handled correctly — two players with the same points AND guesses share the same rank number, and the next rank skips accordingly (e.g. 1, 2, 2, 4).

---

## 📸 Screenshot Feature

Tap the **📸 Screenshot** button to generate a 2000×2000 PNG image of the full leaderboard — perfect for sharing on WhatsApp or Instagram. The image respects the current language direction (LTR for English, RTL for Arabic).

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- **Offline mode**: Any modern browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)
- **Server mode**: Node.js 18 or higher
